    "## Matrix Factorization\n",
    "In the previous exercise we implented ItemKNN which is a Memory-based approach. It means that in order for the model to function we have to keep all known to us interactions (the full interaction matrix) in the memory, this can be cumbersome.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The idea of Model-based approaches is to learn some kind of compact representation of the matrix. Most common scenario is the following: instead of representing every user through all the items and every item through all the users (full interaction matrix) let's represent both in a latent vector space of some smaller dimensionality **f**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that instead of the one full interaction matrix **inter**: (**users** x **items**) we'll need to keep in memory two much smaller matrices: one with user-representations **U**: (**users** x **f**), one with item representations **V**: (**items** x **f**). And we'll learn those two in such a way that we can recreate the information contained in the full interaction matrix, for example through dot product:\n",
    "    \n",
    "inter[**user**, **item**] = U[**user**, :] @ V[**item**, :].T\n",
    "    \n",
    "Such approach is generally called Matrix Factorization, because we split one huge unbearable matrix into multiple smaller bearable ones. It has the following benefits:\n",
    "* The two new matrices combined (should) take less space than the full interaction matrix and thus easier fit into memory;\n",
    "* Selecting a reasonable **f** means that we operate with shorter vectors during all kinds of calculations, this decreases computational load during recommendation making online inference easier;\n",
    "* Matrix factorization compresses sparce information contained in the interaction matrix into an elegant representation and can potentially encode **hidden dependencies**;\n",
    "* Having both items and users represented in the the same **f**-dimensional space opens new possibilities for recommendation;\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first task we utilized a deterministic method (SVD) to obtain user- and item-embeddings. It means that an equation needs to be solved every time we do so, and the whole process (for the whole matrix) needs to be repeated every time a new item or a new user are added to the system. Notice also that with SVD we are doing some extra work by first getting the embbeddings of length k and then truncating them to our desired length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative approach to MF allows us to train embeddings of the desired length straight away, gives more flexibility in setting the training objective and updating the parameters/adding new users (e.g. through 'fine tuning').\n",

    "Your task is to implemet matrix factorization using PyTorch, please follow the specifciactions closely and referer to the provided introduction to PyTorch (separate notebook). Use Moodle forum if you have any questions.\n",

    "First, you need to construct a module consisting of two layers (those will be our **U_final** and **V_final** that we are after):\n",
    "\n",

    "2) An Embedding Layer from Item space to Latent space (item id -> f-dim vector)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the <b>nn.Embedding</b> Module. Implement the forward function: as with SVD we'll set the training objective to reconstruct the interaction matrix. So multiplying U and V (with transposition applied correctly) we should get an approximation of the interaction matrix. "
